"""Python binding for the hidapi library.

pyhidapi is a Python binding for the hidapi library, which provides a
platform-independent interface to USB Human Interface Device (HID)
hardware from user programs. The hidapi library itself is an external
dependency and is not included in the pyhidapi package. The hidapi
library may be found here:

    https://github.com/signal11/hidapi

Users of this module must call hid_init() before calling any other
functions defined by the module.

On the Mac, if the hidapi library is installed under /usr/local/lib,
it may be necessary to set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
to '/usr/local/lib' so that find_library() will search there.

    In non-blocking mode calls to hid_read() will return immediately with
    a value of 0 if there is no data to be read. In blocking mode,
    hid_read() will wait (block) until there is data to read before
    returning. Nonblocking can be turned on and off at any time.

    Arguments:
        device: A device handle returned by hid_open().

        nonblock: Set to True or 1 to enable nonblocking mode.
                  Set to False or 0 to disable nonblocking mode.

    Returns:
        None
        Raises RuntimeError exception if error occurs."""

    The first byte of the data argument  must contain the Report ID. For
    devices which only support a single report, this must be set to 0x00.
    The remaining bytes contain the report data. Since the Report ID is
    mandatory, calls to hid_write() will always contain one more byte
    than the report contains. For example, if a hid report is 16 bytes
    long, 17 bytes must be passed to hid_write(), the Report ID (or 0x00,
    for devices with a single report), followed by the report data (16
    bytes). In this example, the length passed in would be 17.

    hid_write() will send the data on the first OUT endpoint, if one
    exists. If it does not, it will send the data through the Control
    Endpoint (Endpoint 0).

    Arguments:
        device: A device handle returned by hid_open().
